class SlidingBoundariesArchive(ArchiveBase):
    """An archive with a fixed number of sliding boundaries on each dimension.

    This archive is the container described in `Fontaine 2019
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10656>`_. Just like the
    :class:`~ribs.archives.GridArchive`, it can be visualized as an
    n-dimensional grid in the behavior space that is divided into a certain
    number of cells in each dimension. Internally, this archive stores a buffer
    with the ``buffer_capacity`` most recent solutions and uses them to
    determine the boundaries of the behavior characteristics along each
    dimension. After every ``remap_frequency`` solutions are inserted, the
    archive remaps the boundaries based on the solutions in the buffer.

    Initially, the archive has no solutions, so it cannot automatically
    calculate the boundaries. Thus, until the first remap, this archive divides
    the behavior space defined by ``ranges`` into equally sized cells.

    Overall, this archive attempts to make the distribution of the space
    illuminated by the archive more accurately match the true distribution of
    the behavior characteristics when they are not uniformly distributed.

    Args:
        solution_dim (int): Dimension of the solution space.
        dims (array-like): Number of cells in each dimension of the behavior
            space, e.g. ``[20, 30, 40]`` indicates there should be 3 dimensions
            with 20, 30, and 40 cells. (The number of dimensions is implicitly
            defined in the length of this argument).
        ranges (array-like of (float, float)): `Initial` upper and lower bound
            of each dimension of the behavior space, e.g. ``[(-1, 1), (-2, 2)]``
            indicates the first dimension should have bounds :math:`[-1,1]`
            (inclusive), and the second dimension should have bounds
            :math:`[-2,2]` (inclusive). ``ranges`` should be the same length as
            ``dims``.
        epsilon (float): Due to floating point precision errors, we add a small
            epsilon when computing the archive indices in the :meth:`index_of`
            method -- refer to the implementation `here
            <../_modules/ribs/archives/_sliding_boundaries_archive.html#SlidingBoundariesArchive.index_of>`_.
            Pass this parameter to configure that epsilon.
        seed (int): Value to seed the random number generator. Set to None to
            avoid a fixed seed.
        dtype (str or data-type): Data type of the solutions, objectives,
            and measures. We only support ``"f"`` / ``np.float32`` and ``"d"`` /
            ``np.float64``.
        remap_frequency (int): Frequency of remapping. Archive will remap once
            after ``remap_frequency`` number of solutions has been found.
        buffer_capacity (int): Number of solutions to keep in the buffer.
            Solutions in the buffer will be reinserted into the archive after
            remapping.

        At this point, we have "grid indices" -- indices of each measure in each

        converting between grid and integer indices.

        As an example, the grid indices can be used to access boundaries of a
        measure value's cell. For example, the following retrieves the lower
