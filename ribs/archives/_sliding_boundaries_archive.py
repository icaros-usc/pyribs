class SlidingBoundariesArchive(ArchiveBase):
    """An archive with a fixed number of sliding boundaries on each dimension.

    This archive is the container described in `Fontaine 2019
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10656>`_. Just like the
    :class:`~ribs.archives.GridArchive`, it can be visualized as an
    n-dimensional grid in the measure space that is divided into a certain
    number of cells in each dimension. Internally, this archive stores a buffer
    with the ``buffer_capacity`` most recent solutions and uses them to
    determine the boundaries of each dimension of the measure space. After every
    ``remap_frequency`` solutions are inserted, the archive remaps the
    boundaries based on the solutions in the buffer.

    Initially, the archive has no solutions, so it cannot automatically
    calculate the boundaries. Thus, until the first remap, this archive divides
    the measure space defined by ``ranges`` into equally sized cells.

    Overall, this archive attempts to make the distribution of the space
    illuminated by the archive more accurately match the true distribution of
    the measures when they are not uniformly distributed.

    .. note:: Unlike other archives, this archive does not currently support
        `thresholds <../../tutorials/cma_mae.html>`_ or batched addition (see
        :meth:`add`).

    Args:
        solution_dim (int): Dimension of the solution space.
        dims (array-like): Number of cells in each dimension of the measure
            space, e.g. ``[20, 30, 40]`` indicates there should be 3 dimensions
            with 20, 30, and 40 cells. (The number of dimensions is implicitly
            defined in the length of this argument).
        ranges (array-like of (float, float)): `Initial` upper and lower bound
            of each dimension of the measure space, e.g. ``[(-1, 1), (-2, 2)]``
            indicates the first dimension should have bounds :math:`[-1,1]`
            (inclusive), and the second dimension should have bounds
            :math:`[-2,2]` (inclusive). ``ranges`` should be the same length as
            ``dims``.
        epsilon (float): Due to floating point precision errors, we add a small
            epsilon when computing the archive indices in the :meth:`index_of`
            method -- refer to the implementation `here
            <../_modules/ribs/archives/_sliding_boundaries_archive.html#SlidingBoundariesArchive.index_of>`_.
            Pass this parameter to configure that epsilon.
        qd_score_offset (float): Archives often contain negative objective
            values, and if the QD score were to be computed with these negative
            objectives, the algorithm would be penalized for adding new cells
            with negative objectives. Thus, a standard practice is to normalize
            all the objectives so that they are non-negative by introducing an
            offset. This QD score offset will be *subtracted* from all
            objectives in the archive, e.g., if your objectives go as low as
            -300, pass in -300 so that each objective will be transformed as
            ``objective - (-300)``.
        seed (int): Value to seed the random number generator. Set to None to
            avoid a fixed seed.
        dtype (str or data-type): Data type of the solutions, objectives,
            and measures. We only support ``"f"`` / ``np.float32`` and ``"d"`` /
            ``np.float64``.
        remap_frequency (int): Frequency of remapping. Archive will remap once
            after ``remap_frequency`` number of solutions has been found.
        buffer_capacity (int): Number of solutions to keep in the buffer.
            Solutions in the buffer will be reinserted into the archive after
            remapping.
