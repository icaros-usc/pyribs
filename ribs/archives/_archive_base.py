class ArchiveBase(ABC):
    """Base class for archives.

    An archive stores *elites*. Each elite consists of several data *fields*: at a
    minimum, the elite has a *solution* and the evaluated *objective* and *measures* of
    the solution. The elite may also include additional data fields. Besides elites,
    archives can store components like k-D trees and density estimators.

    The primary method of an archive is to write new solutions to it with :meth:`add`.
    There are also methods to read from the archive, such as :meth:`retrieve` and
    :meth:`data`. These methods typically operate over batches of inputs (e.g., adding
    multiple solutions at once with :meth:`add`), but methods such as :meth:`add_single`
    and :meth:`retrieve_single` support single inputs.

    Due to the flexibility of workflows available in pyribs, it is possible to design
    archives that require only a small subset of the methods in this base class. As
    such, none of the methods listed here are required to be implemented in child
    classes, although by default they will raise :class:`NotImplementedError` when
    called.

    Args:
        solution_dim: Dimensionality of the solution space. Scalar or multi-dimensional
            solution shapes are allowed by passing an empty tuple or tuple of integers,
            respectively.
        objective_dim: Dimensionality of the objective space. For single-objective
            optimization problems where the objective is a scalar, this argument should
            be an empty tuple ``()``. In multi-objective optimization problems, this
            argument should be an integer indicating the number of objectives.
        measure_dim: Dimensionality of the measure space.

                  measures = archive.data("measures")

            Otherwise, the returned data can take the following forms, depending on the
            ``return_type`` argument:

            - ``return_type="dict"``: Dict mapping from the field name to the field data
              at the given indices. An example is::

                  {
                    "solution": [[1.0, 1.0, ...], ...],
                    "objective": [1.5, ...],
                    "measures": [[1.0, 2.0], ...],
                    ...
                  }

              The keys in this dict can be modified with the ``fields`` arg; duplicate
              fields will be ignored since the dict stores unique keys.

            - ``return_type="tuple"``: Tuple of arrays matching the field order in
              ``fields``. For instance, if ``fields`` is ``["objective", "measures"]``,
              this method would return a tuple of ``(objective_arr, measures_arr)`` that
              could be unpacked as::

                  objective, measures = archive.data(["objective", "measures"],
                                                     return_type="tuple")

              Unlike with the ``dict`` return type, duplicate fields will show up as
              duplicate entries in the tuple, e.g., ``fields=["objective",
              "objective"]`` will result in two objective arrays being returned.

              When ``fields=None`` (the default case), the fields in the tuple will be
              ordered according to the :attr:`field_list`.

            - ``return_type="pandas"``: An :class:`~ribs.archives.ArchiveDataFrame` with
              the following columns:

              - For fields that are scalars, a single column with the field name. For
                example, ``objective`` would have a single column called ``objective``.
              - For fields that are 1D arrays, multiple columns with the name suffixed
                by its index. To illustrate, for a ``measures`` field of length 10, the
                dataframe would contain 10 columns with names ``measures_0``,
                ``measures_1``, ..., ``measures_9``. **The output format for fields with
                >1D data is currently not defined.**

              In short, the dataframe might look like this by default:

              +------------+------+-----------+------------+------+
              | solution_0 | ...  | objective | measures_0 | ...  |
              +============+======+===========+============+======+

              +------------+------+-----------+------------+------+

              Like the other return types, the columns returned can be adjusted with the
              ``fields`` parameter.

        Raises:
            ValueError: Invalid field name provided.
            ValueError: Invalid return_type provided.
