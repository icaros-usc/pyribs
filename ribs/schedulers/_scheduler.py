class Scheduler:
    """A basic class that composes an archive with multiple emitters.

    To use this class, first create an archive and list of emitters for the
    QD algorithm. Then, construct the Scheduler with these arguments. Finally,
    repeatedly call :meth:`ask` to collect solutions to analyze, and return the
    objective and measures of those solutions **in the same order** using
    :meth:`tell`.

    As all solutions go into the same archive, the  emitters passed in must emit
    solutions with the same dimension (that is, their ``solution_dim`` attribute
    must be the same).

    .. warning:: If you are constructing many emitters at once, do not do
        something like ``[EmitterClass(...)] * 5``, as this creates a list with
        the same instance of ``EmitterClass`` in each position. Instead, use
        ``[EmitterClass(...) for _ in range 5]``, which creates 5 unique
        instances of ``EmitterClass``.

    Args:
        archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): An archive object, e.g. one
            selected from :mod:`ribs.archives`.
        emitters (list of ribs.archives.EmitterBase): A list of emitter objects,
            e.g. :class:`ribs.emitters.GaussianEmitter`.
        add_mode (str): Indicates how solutions should be added to the archive.
            The default is "batch", which adds all solutions with one call to
            :meth:`~ribs.archives.ArchiveBase.add`. Alternatively, use "single"
            to add the solutions one at a time with
            :meth:`~ribs.archives.ArchiveBase.add_single`. "single" mode is
            included for legacy reasons, as it was the only mode of operation in
            pyribs 0.4.0 and before. We highly recommend using "batch" mode
            since it is significantly faster.
        result_archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): In some algorithms, such as
            CMA-MAE, the archive does not store all the best-performing
            solutions. The `result_archive` is a secondary archive where we can
            store all the best-performing solutions.
    Raises:
        TypeError: The `emitters` argument was not a list of emitters.
        ValueError: The emitters passed in do not have the same solution
            dimensions.
        ValueError: There is no emitter passed in.
        ValueError: The same emitter instance was passed in multiple times. Each
            emitter should be a unique instance (see the warning above).
