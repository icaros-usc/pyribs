class GradientArborescenceEmitter(EmitterBase):
    """Generates solutions with a gradient arborescence, with coefficients
    parameterized by an evolution strategy.

    This emitter originates in `Fontaine 2021
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03894>`_. It leverages the gradient information
    of the objective and measure functions, generating new solutions around a
    *solution point* :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\theta}` using *gradient
    arborescence*, with coefficients drawn from a Gaussian distribution.
    Essentially, this means that the emitter samples coefficients
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{c_i} \\sim
    \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})`
    and creates new solutions :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\theta'_i}` according to

    .. math::

        \\boldsymbol{\\theta'_i} \\gets \\boldsymbol{\\theta} +
            c_{i,0} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} f(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) +
            \\sum_{j=1}^k c_{i,j}\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}m_j(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})

    Where :math:`k` is the number of measures, and
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} f(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})` and
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} m_j(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})` are the objective
    and measure gradients of the solution point :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\theta}`,
    respectively.

    Based on how the solutions are ranked after being inserted into the archive
    (see ``ranker``), the solution point :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\theta}` is
    updated with gradient ascent, and the coefficient distribution parameters
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\mu}` and :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}` are updated
    with an ES (the default ES is CMA-ES).

    .. note::

        Unlike non-gradient emitters, GradientArborescenceEmitter requires
        calling :meth:`ask_dqd` and :meth:`tell_dqd` (in this order) before
        calling :meth:`ask` and :meth:`tell` to communicate the gradient
        information to the emitter.

    See Also:

        Our DQD tutorial goes into detail on how to use this emitter:
        :doc:`/tutorials/tom_cruise_dqd`

    Args:
        archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): An archive to use when creating and
            inserting solutions. For instance, this can be
            :class:`ribs.archives.GridArchive`.
        x0 (np.ndarray): Initial solution.
        sigma0 (float): Initial step size / standard deviation of the
            distribution of gradient coefficients.
        lr (float): Learning rate for the gradient optimizer.
        ranker (Callable or str): The ranker is a :class:`RankerBase` object
            that orders the solutions after they have been evaluated in the
            environment. This parameter may be a callable (e.g. a class or a
            lambda function) that takes in no parameters and returns an instance
            of :class:`RankerBase`, or it may be a full or abbreviated ranker
            name as described in :mod:`ribs.emitters.rankers`.
        selection_rule ("mu" or "filter"): Method for selecting parents in
            CMA-ES. With "mu" selection, the first half of the solutions will be
            selected as parents, while in "filter", any solutions that were
            added to the archive will be selected.
        restart_rule (int, "no_improvement", and "basic"): Method to use when
            checking for restarts. If given an integer, then the emitter will
            restart after this many iterations, where each iteration is a call
            to :meth:`tell`. With "basic", only the default CMA-ES convergence
            rules will be used, while with "no_improvement", the emitter will
            restart when none of the proposed solutions were added to the
            archive.
        grad_opt (Callable or str): Gradient optimizer to use for the gradient
            ascent step of the algorithm. The optimizer is a
            :class:`~ribs.emitters.opt.GradientOptBase` object. This parameter
            may be a callable (e.g. a class or a lambda function) which takes in
            the ``theta0`` and ``lr`` arguments, or it may be a full or
            abbreviated name as described in :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt`.
        grad_opt_kwargs (dict): Additional arguments to pass to the gradient
            optimizer. See the gradient-based optimizers in
            :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt` for the arguments allowed by each
            optimizer. Note that we already pass in ``theta0`` and ``lr``.
        es (Callable or str): The evolution strategy is an
            :class:`EvolutionStrategyBase` object that is used to adapt the
            distribution from which new gradient coefficients are sampled. This
            parameter may be a callable (e.g. a class or a lambda function) that
            takes in the parameters of :class:`EvolutionStrategyBase` along with
            kwargs provided by the ``es_kwargs`` argument, or it may be a full
            or abbreviated optimizer name as described in
            :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt`.
        es_kwargs (dict): Additional arguments to pass to the evolution
            strategy optimizer. See the evolution-strategy-based optimizers in
            :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt` for the arguments allowed by each
            optimizer.
        normalize_grad (bool): If true (default), then gradient infomation will
            be normalized. Otherwise, it will not be normalized.
        bounds: This argument may be used for providing solution space bounds in
            the future. This emitter does not currently support solution space
            bounds, as bounding solutions for DQD algorithms such as CMA-MEGA is
            an open problem. Hence, this argument must be set to None.
        batch_size (int): Number of solutions to return in :meth:`ask`. If not
            passed in, a batch size will be automatically calculated using the
            default CMA-ES rules. This **does not** account for the **one**
            solution returned by :meth:`ask_dqd`, which is the solution point
            maintained by the gradient optimizer.
        epsilon (float): For numerical stability, we add a small epsilon when
            normalizing gradients in :meth:`tell_dqd` -- refer to the
            implementation `here
            <../_modules/ribs/emitters/_gradient_arborescence_emitter.html#GradientArborescenceEmitter.tell_dqd>`_.
            Pass this parameter to configure that epsilon.
        seed (int): Value to seed the random number generator. Set to None to
            avoid a fixed seed.
    Raises:
        ValueError: There is an error in x0 or initial_solutions.
        ValueError: ``bounds`` is set even though it is not currently supported.
        ValueError: If ``restart_rule``, ``selection_rule``, or ``ranker`` is
            invalid.
