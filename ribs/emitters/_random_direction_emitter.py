class RandomDirectionEmitter(EmitterBase):
    """Performs a random walk in behavior space by pursuing randomly chosen
    behavior space directions.

    This emitter originates in the `CMA-ME paper
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02400>`_. Initially, it will start at ``x0`` and
    use CMA-ES to search for solutions along a randomly chosen direction. Once
    CMA-ES restarts (see ``restart_rule``), the emitter will start from a
    randomly chosen elite in the archive and pursue a new random direction.

    Args:
        archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): An archive to use when creating and
            inserting solutions. For instance, this can be
            :class:`ribs.archives.GridArchive`.
        x0 (np.ndarray): Initial solution.
        sigma0 (float): Initial step size.
        selection_rule ("mu" or "filter"): Method for selecting solutions in
            CMA-ES. With "mu" selection, the first half of the solutions will be
            selected, while in "filter", any solutions that were added to the
            archive will be selected.
        restart_rule ("no_improvement" or "basic"): Method to use when checking
            for restart. With "basic", only the default CMA-ES convergence rules
            will be used, while with "no_improvement", the emitter will also
            restart when none of the proposed solutions were added to the
            archive.
        weight_rule ("truncation" or "active"): Method for generating weights in
            CMA-ES. Either "truncation" (positive weights only) or "active"
            (include negative weights).
        bounds (None or array-like): Bounds of the solution space. Solutions are
            clipped to these bounds. Pass None to indicate there are no bounds.

            Pass an array-like to specify the bounds for each dim. Each element
            in this array-like can be None to indicate no bound, or a tuple of
            ``(lower_bound, upper_bound)``, where ``lower_bound`` or
            ``upper_bound`` may be None to indicate no bound.
        batch_size (int): Number of solutions to send back in :meth:`ask`.
            If not passed in, a batch size will automatically be calculated.
        seed (int): Value to seed the random number generator. Set to None to
            avoid a fixed seed.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If any of ``selection_rule``, ``restart_rule``, or
            ``weight_rule`` is invalid.
