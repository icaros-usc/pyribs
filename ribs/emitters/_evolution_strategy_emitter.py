class EvolutionStrategyEmitter(EmitterBase):
    """Adapts a distribution of solutions with an ES.

    This emitter originates in `Fontaine 2020
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02400>`_. The multivariate Gaussian solution
    distribution begins at ``x0`` with standard deviation ``sigma0``. Based on
    how the generated solutions are ranked (see ``ranker``), the ES then adapts
    the mean and covariance of the distribution.

    Args:
        archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): An archive to use when creating
            and inserting solutions. For instance, this can be
            :class:`ribs.archives.GridArchive`.
        x0 (np.ndarray): Initial solution. Must be 1-dimensional.
        sigma0 (float): Initial step size / standard deviation of the
            distribution from which solutions are sampled.
        ranker (Callable or str): The ranker is a :class:`RankerBase` object
            that orders the solutions after they have been evaluated in the
            environment. This parameter may be a callable (e.g. a class or
            a lambda function) that takes in no parameters and returns an
            instance of :class:`RankerBase`, or it may be a full or abbreviated
            ranker name as described in
            :meth:`ribs.emitters.rankers.get_ranker`.
        es (Callable or str): The evolution strategy is an
            :class:`EvolutionStrategyBase` object that is used to adapt the
            distribution from which new solutions are sampled. This parameter
            may be a callable (e.g. a class or a lambda function) that takes in
            the parameters of :class:`EvolutionStrategyBase` along with kwargs
            provided by the ``es_kwargs`` argument, or it may be a full or
            abbreviated optimizer name as described in :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt`.
        es_kwargs (dict): Additional arguments to pass to the evolution
            strategy optimizer. See the evolution-strategy-based optimizers in
            :mod:`ribs.emitters.opt` for the arguments allowed by each
            optimizer.
        selection_rule ("mu" or "filter"): Method for selecting parents for the
            evolution strategy. With "mu" selection, the first half of the
            solutions will be selected as parents, while in "filter", any
            solutions that were added to the archive will be selected.
        restart_rule (int, "no_improvement", and "basic"): Method to use when
            checking for restarts. If given an integer, then the emitter will
            restart after this many iterations, where each iteration is a call
            to :meth:`tell`. With "basic", only the default CMA-ES convergence
            rules will be used, while with "no_improvement", the emitter will
            restart when none of the proposed solutions were added to the
            archive.
        bounds (None or array-like): Bounds of the solution space. As suggested
            in `Biedrzycki 2020
            <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210650219301622>`_,
            solutions are resampled until they fall within these bounds.  Pass
            None to indicate there are no bounds. Alternatively, pass an
            array-like to specify the bounds for each dim. Each element in this
            array-like can be None to indicate no bound, or a tuple of
            ``(lower_bound, upper_bound)``, where ``lower_bound`` or
            ``upper_bound`` may be None to indicate no bound.
        batch_size (int): Number of solutions to return in :meth:`ask`. If not
            passed in, a batch size will be automatically calculated using the
            default CMA-ES rules.
        seed (int): Value to seed the random number generator. Set to None to
            avoid a fixed seed.
    Raises:
        ValueError: There is an error in x0 or initial_solutions.
        ValueError: There is an error in the bounds configuration.
        ValueError: If ``restart_rule``, ``selection_rule``, or ``ranker`` is
            invalid.
