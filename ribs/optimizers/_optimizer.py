class Optimizer:
    """A basic class that composes an archive with multiple emitters.

    To use this class, first create an archive and list of emitters for the
    QD algorithm. Then, construct the Optimizer with these arguments. Finally,
    repeatedly call :meth:`ask` to collect solutions to analyze, and return the
    objective values and measures values of those solutions **in the same
    order** using :meth:`tell`.

    As all solutions go into the same archive, the  emitters passed in must emit
    solutions with the same dimension (that is, their ``solution_dim`` attribute
    must be the same).

    .. warning:: If you are constructing many emitters at once, do not do
        something like ``[EmitterClass(...)] * 5``, as this creates a list with
        the same instance of ``EmitterClass`` in each position. Instead, use
        ``[EmitterClass(...) for _ in range 5]``, which creates 5 unique
        instances of ``EmitterClass``.

    Args:
        archive (ribs.archives.ArchiveBase): An archive object, selected from
            :mod:`ribs.archives`.
        emitters (list of ribs.archives.EmitterBase): A list of emitter objects,
            such as :class:`ribs.emitters.GaussianEmitter`.
    Raises:
        ValueError: The emitters passed in do not have the same solution
            dimensions.
        ValueError: There is no emitter passed in.
        ValueError: The same emitter instance was passed in multiple times. Each
            emitter should be a unique instance (see the warning above).
