Tutorials contain detailed explanations of ribs usage in a Python notebook.
These may be run locally with Jupyter, as well as on Colab. If running locally,
make sure to have
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
installed. Each notebook contains cell magic that installs the dependencies it
needs for execution.

Below is the list of tutorials, sorted _roughly_ in order of difficulty.
