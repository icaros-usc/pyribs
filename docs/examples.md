These examples provide single Python files with fewer explanations than
tutorials. To run each example, first install the dependencies listed at the top
of each file, then follow the usage instructions. Here are the current examples:

- {doc}`examples/sphere`: Demonstrates how to set up recent QD algorithms and
  apply them to the sphere benchmark function.
- {doc}`examples/lunar_lander`: An extended version of the
  [Lunar Lander tutorial](tutorials/lunar_lander) which distributes evaluations
  with Dask and adds other features such as a command-line interface.
