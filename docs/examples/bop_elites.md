# BOP-Elites

Introduced in
[Kent 2024](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10472301), Bayesian
Optimization of Elites (BOP-Elites) adapts methods from Bayesian optimization to
model the objective and measure functions and select solutions to evaluate. The
script below shows how to implement BOP-Elites on the sphere linear projection
benchmark.
