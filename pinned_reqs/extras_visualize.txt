# The reference images in the repo were created with these dependencies --
# in general, it's quite hard to make the visualization tests robust because
# they are vulnerable to various API changes and even internal implementation
# decisions of these libraries (e.g., changes in random number generator usage),
# but by keeping these dependencies fairly recent, we can minimize these issues
# since these are roughly the versions that we develop with.
