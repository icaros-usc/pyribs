"""Runs various QD algorithms on the Sphere function.

The sphere function in this example is adapted from Section 4 of Fontaine 2020
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02400). Namely, each solution value is clipped to
the range [-5.12, 5.12], and the optimum is moved from [0,..] to [0.4 * 5.12 =
2.048,..]. Furthermore, the objective values are normalized to the range [0,
100] where 100 is the maximum and corresponds to 0 on the original sphere
function.

There are two BCs in this example. The first is the sum of the first n/2 clipped
values of the solution, and the second is the sum of the last n/2 clipped values
of the solution. Having each BC depend equally on several values in the solution
space makes the problem more difficult (refer to Fontaine 2020 for more info).

The supported algorithms are:
- `map_elites`: GridArchive with GaussianEmitter
- `line_map_elites`: GridArchive with IsoLineEmitter
- `cvt_map_elites`: CVTArchive with GaussianEmitter
- `line_cvt_map_elites`: CVTArchive with IsoLineEmitter
- `cma_me_imp`: GridArchive with ImprovementEmitter
- `cma_me_imp_mu`: GridArchive with ImprovementEmitter with mu selection rule
- `cma_me_rd`: GridArchive with RandomDirectionEmitter
- `cma_me_rd_mu`: GridArchive with RandomDirectionEmitter with mu selection rule
- `cma_me_opt`: GridArchive with OptimizingEmitter
- `cma_me_mixed`: GridArchive, and half (7) of the emitter are
  RandomDirectionEmitter and half (8) are ImprovementEmitter

All algorithms use 15 emitters, each with a batch size of 37. Each one runs for
4500 iterations for a total of 15 * 37 * 4500 ~= 2.5M evaluations.

Note that the CVTArchive in this example uses 10,000 cells, as opposed to the
250,000 (500x500) in the GridArchive, so it is not fair to directly compare
`cvt_map_elites` and `line_cvt_map_elites` to the other algorithms. However, the
other algorithms may be fairly compared because they use the same archive.

Outputs are saved in the `sphere_output/` directory by default. The archive is
saved as a CSV named `{algorithm}_{dim}_archive.csv`, while snapshots of the
heatmap are saved as `{algorithm}_{dim}_heatmap_{iteration}.png`. Metrics about
the run are also saved in `{algorithm}_{dim}_metrics.json`, and plots of the
metrics are saved in PNG's with the name `{algorithm}_{dim}_metric_name.png`.

To generate a video of the heatmap from the heatmap images, use a tool like
ffmpeg. For example, the following will generate a 6FPS video showing the
heatmap for cma_me_imp with 20 dims.

    ffmpeg -r 6 -i "sphere_output/cma_me_imp_20_heatmap_%*.png" \
        sphere_output/cma_me_imp_20_heatmap_video.mp4
