    "# Generating Images to Fool an MNIST Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their high performance on classification tasks such as MNIST, neural networks like the [LeNet-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet) have a weakness: they are easy to fool. Namely, given images like the ones below, a classifier may confidently believe that it is seeing certain digits, even though the images look like random noise to humans. Naturally, this phenomenon raises some concerns, especially when the network in question is used in a safety-critical system like a self-driving car. Given such unrecognizable input, one would hope that the network at least has low confidence in its prediction.\n",

    "![fooling images example](_static/fooling_mnist_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make matters worse for neural networks, generating such images is incredibly easy with QD algorithms. As shown in [Nguyen 2015](http://anhnguyen.me/project/fooling/), one can use simple MAP-Elites to generate these images. In this tutorial, we will instead use the pyribs version of MAP-Elites to do just that."

Note that MAP-Elites may not find images for all the digits, and this is mostly due to the small behavior space. Usually, QD algorithms run with fairly large behavior spaces. This is something to keep in mind when tuning QD algorithms."
