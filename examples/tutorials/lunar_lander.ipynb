    "# Lunar Lander Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to use the `ribs` implementaiton of MAP-Elites to solve OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander problem. Specifically, the environment we'll be using is `LunarLander-v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI Gym is a common toolkit used to test and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides various environments/problems for algorithms to solve. In our case, we'll be trying to get a lunar lander to land successfully on the moon within a certain target area. To find out more, visit [OpenAI's page](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) on this environment. Using MAP-Elites, we'll discover and visualize a diverse range of solutions to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with the MAP-Elites algorithm, take a look at [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909) which introduces the algorithm that we use in this notebook. It should be noted that while the algorithm in the paper minimizes performance, the `ribs` implementation maximizes performance instead. Additionally, instead of generating random solutions in the initial stage of MAP-Elites, our implementation samples from a Gaussian distribution."

    "`GridArchive` is a container class used to house the solutions generated by MAP-Elites. It is our map of elites. When constructing a `GridArchive`, you can specify its dimensions, the range of valid values in our behaviour space, and certain configuration settings. These configuration settings include a seed for getting random solutions in the archive to mutate, which is essential to MAP-Elites, and a batch size. This batch size is not important for `GridArchive` but it is important for `Optimizer`, which we'll discuss soon.\n",

    "- `[(0, 1000), (-1., 1.)]` specifies upper and lower bounds for each dimension of the behavior space. In the case of Lunar Lander, we want to consider timesteps and x-position of the Lunar Lander in the environment. According to OpenAI Gym documention, each simulation can take at least 0 timesteps and at most 1000 timesteps, so we specify `(0, 1000)`. Looking at `LunarLander-v2`'s source code, we find that the minimum x-position value for the lander is -1.0 and the maximum value is 1.0, so we specify `(-1., 1.)`.\n",
