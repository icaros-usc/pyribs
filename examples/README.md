# Examples

This directory contains examples for using pyribs. For the most part, these are
Python files with comments on usage and some explanations. For more detailed
explanations of pyribs, the `tutorials` directory contains Jupyter notebooks
with more complete explanations; these are also included in the documentation at
<https://ribs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>.

To run these examples, you will need to install some additional dependencies
with `pip install ribs[examples]` or `pip install -e .[examples]`.

For descriptions of these examples, see
<https://ribs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>.
