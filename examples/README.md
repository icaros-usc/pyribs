# Examples

This directory contains examples for using pyribs. The `tutorials` directory
contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations; these are also included
in the documentation on the
[Tutorials](https://ribs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) page.

The rest of this directory contains Python files with comments on usage and some
explanations. These are intended for slightly more experienced users. For
descriptions of these examples, see the
[Examples](https://ribs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) page in the
documentation.

To run these examples locally, you will need to install some additional
dependencies with `pip install ribs[examples]` or `pip install -e .[examples]`.
