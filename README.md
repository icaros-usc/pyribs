A _bare-bones_ Python library for quality diversity (QD) optimization. Pyribs
implements the highly modular _Rapid Illumination of Behavior Space (RIBS)_
framework for QD optimization. Pyribs is also the official implementation of
Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME), Covariance Matrix Adaptation
MAP-Elites via a Gradient Arborescence (CMA-MEGA), Covariance Matrix Adaptation
MAP-Annealing (CMA-MAE), and scalable variants of CMA-MAE.

## Overview

![Types of Optimization](readme_assets/optimization_types.png)

[Quality diversity (QD) optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04322) is a
subfield of optimization where solutions generated cover every point in a
_measure_ space while simultaneously maximizing (or minimizing) a single
_objective_. QD algorithms within the MAP-Elites family of QD algorithms produce
heatmaps (archives) as output where each cell contains the best discovered
representative of a region in measure space.

> In the QD literature, measure function outputs have also been referred to as
> "behavioral characteristics," "behavior descriptors," or "feature
> descriptors."

Recent years have seen the development of a large number of QD algorithms. To
represent these and future algorithms, we have developed the highly modular RIBS
framework. RIBS divides a QD algorithm into three components:

- An **archive**, which saves generated solutions within measure space.
- One or more **emitters**, where each emitter is an algorithm which generates
  new candidate solutions and responds to feedback about how the solutions were
  evaluated and how they were inserted into the archive.
- A **scheduler** which controls the interaction of the **archive** and
  **emitters**. The **scheduler** also provides an interface for requesting new
  candidate solutions and telling the algorithm how candidates performed.

By interchanging these components, a user can compose a large number of QD
algorithms.

Pyribs is an implementation of the RIBS framework designed to support a wide
range of users, from beginners entering the field to experienced researchers
seeking to develop new algorithms. Pyribs achieves these goals by embodying
three principles:

- **Simple:** Centered _only_ on components that are absolutely necessary to run
  a QD algorithm, allowing users to combine the framework with other software
  frameworks.
- **Flexible:** Capable of representing a wide range of current and future QD
  algorithms, allowing users to easily create or modify components.
- **Accessible:** Easy to install and learn, particularly for beginners with
  limited computational resources.

In contrast to other QD libraries, pyribs is "bare-bones." For example, like
[pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/), pyribs focuses solely on optimizing
fixed-dimensional continuous domains. Focusing on this one commonly-occurring
problem allows us to optimize the library for performance as well as ease of
use. Refer to the list of [additional QD libraries](#additional-qd-libraries)
below if you need greater performance or have additional use cases.

Following the RIBS framework (shown in the figure below), a standard algorithm
in pyribs operates as follows:

1. The user calls the `ask()` method on the scheduler. The scheduler requests
   solutions from each emitter by calling the emitter's `ask()` method.
2. The user evaluates solutions to obtain the objective and measure values.
3. The user passes the evaluations to the scheduler's `tell()` method. The
   scheduler adds the solutions into the archive and receives feedback. The
   scheduler passes this feedback along with the evaluated solutions to each
   emitter's `tell()` method, and each emitter then updates its internal state.

## Paper

Two years after the initial release of pyribs, we released a paper that
elaborates on the RIBS framework and the design decisions behind pyribs! For

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of quality diversity (QD) optimization, a branch of optimization that seeks to find a collection of diverse, high-performing solutions to a given problem. To grow further, we believe the QD community faces two challenges: developing a framework to represent the field's growing array of algorithms, and implementing that framework in software that supports a range of researchers and practitioners. To address these challenges, we have developed pyribs, a library built on a highly modular conceptual QD framework. By replacing components in the conceptual framework, and hence in pyribs, users can compose algorithms from across the QD literature; equally important, they can identify unexplored algorithm variations. Furthermore, pyribs makes this framework simple, flexible, and accessible, with a user-friendly API supported by extensive documentation and tutorials. This paper overviews the creation of pyribs, focusing on the conceptual framework that it implements and the design principles that have guided the library's development.

## Usage

Here we show an example application of CMA-ME in pyribs. To initialize the
algorithm, we first create:

- A 2D **GridArchive** where each dimension contains 20 cells across the range
  [-1, 1].
- Three instances of **EvolutionStrategyEmitter**, all of which start from the
  search point **0** in 10-dimensional space and a Gaussian sampling
  distribution with standard deviation 0.1.
- A **Scheduler** that combines the archive and emitters together.

After initializing the components, we optimize (pyribs maximizes) the negative
10-D Sphere function for 1000 iterations. Users of
[pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/) will be familiar with the ask-tell
interface (which pyribs adopted). First, the user must `ask` the scheduler for
new candidate solutions. After evaluating the solution, they `tell` the
scheduler the objectives and measures of each candidate solution. The algorithm
then populates the archive and makes decisions on where to sample solutions
next. Our toy example uses the first two parameters of the search space as
measures.

```python
import numpy as np

from ribs.archives import GridArchive
from ribs.emitters import EvolutionStrategyEmitter
from ribs.schedulers import Scheduler

archive = GridArchive(
    solution_dim=10,
    dims=[20, 20],
    ranges=[(-1, 1), (-1, 1)],
)
emitters = [
    EvolutionStrategyEmitter(
        archive,
        x0=[0.0] * 10,
        sigma0=0.1,
    ) for _ in range(3)
]
scheduler = Scheduler(archive, emitters)

for itr in range(1000):
    solutions = scheduler.ask()

    # Optimize the 10D negative Sphere function.
    objective_batch = -np.sum(np.square(solutions), axis=1)

    # Measures: first 2 coordinates of each 10D solution.
    measures_batch = solutions[:, :2]

    scheduler.tell(objective_batch, measures_batch)
```

To visualize this archive with Matplotlib, we then use the
`grid_archive_heatmap` function from `ribs.visualize`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ribs.visualize import grid_archive_heatmap

grid_archive_heatmap(archive)
plt.show()
```
