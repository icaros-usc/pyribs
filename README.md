A _bare-bones_ Python library for quality diversity optimization. pyribs is the
official implementation of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME)
algorithm and implements the _Rapid Illumination of Behavior Space (RIBS)_
redesign of MAP-Elites detailed in the paper
[Covariance Matrix Adapation for the Rapid Illumination of Behavior Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02400).

## Overview

![Types of Optimization](readme_assets/optimization_types.png)

[Quality diversity (QD) optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04322) is a
subfield of optimization where solutions generated cover every point in a
_measure_ space while simultaneously maximizing (or minimizing) a single
_objective_. QD algorithms within the MAP-Elites family of QD algorithms produce
heatmaps (archives) as output where each cell contains the best discovered
representative of a region in measure space.

> In the QD literature, measure function outputs have also been referred to as
> "behavior characteristics," "behavior descriptors," or "feature descriptors."

While many QD libraries exist, this particular library aims to be the QD analog
to the [pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/) library (a single objective
optimization library). In contrast to other QD libraries, this library is
"bare-bones," meaning pyribs (like [pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/))
focuses solely on optimizing fixed-dimensional continuous domains. Focusing
solely on this one commonly-occurring problem allows us to optimize the library
for performance as well as ease of use. Refer to the list of
[additional QD libraries](#additional-qd-libraries) below if you need greater
performance or have additional use cases.

A user of pyribs selects three components that meet the needs of their
application:

- An **Archive** saves the best representatives generated within measure space.
- **Emitters** control how new candidate solutions are generated and affect if
  the algorithm prioritizes quality or diversity.
- A **Scheduler** joins the **Archive** and **Emitters** together and acts as a
  scheduling algorithm for emitters. The **Scheduler** provides an interface for
  requesting new candidate solutions and telling the algorithm how candidates
  performed.

## Usage

Here we show an example application of CMA-ME in pyribs. To initialize the
algorithm, we first create:

- A 2D **GridArchive** where each dimension contains 20 cells across the range
  [-1, 1].
- An **ImprovementEmitter**, which starts from the search point **0** in 10
  dimensional space and a Gaussian sampling distribution with standard deviation
  0.1.
- A **Scheduler** that combines the archive and emitter together.

After initializing the components, we optimize (pyribs maximizes) the negative
10-D Sphere function for 1000 iterations. Users of
[pycma](https://pypi.org/project/cma/) will be familiar with the ask-tell
interface (which pyribs adopted). First, the user must `ask` the scheduler for
new candidate solutions. After evaluating the solution, they `tell` the
scheduler the objectives and measures of each candidate solution. The algorithm
then populates the archive and makes decisions on where to sample solutions
next. Our toy example uses the first two parameters of the search space as
measures.

```python
import numpy as np

from ribs.archives import GridArchive
from ribs.emitters import ImprovementEmitter
from ribs.scheduler import Scheduler

archive = GridArchive(solution_dim=len([0.0] * 10), dims=[20, 20], ranges=[(-1, 1), (-1, 1)])
emitters = [ImprovementEmitter(archive, [0.0] * 10, 0.1)]
scheduler = Scheduler(archive, emitters)

for itr in range(1000):
    solutions = scheduler.ask()

    objectives = -np.sum(np.square(solutions), axis=1)
    measures = solutions[:, :2]

    scheduler.tell(objectives, measures)
```

To visualize this archive with matplotlib, we then use the
`grid_archive_heatmap` function from `ribs.visualize`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ribs.visualize import grid_archive_heatmap

grid_archive_heatmap(archive)
plt.show()
```

## Installation

pyribs supports Python 3.7-3.10. Earlier Python versions may work but are not
officially supported. To find the installation command for your system
(including for installing from source), visit the
[installation selector](https://pyribs.org/#installation) on our website.

To test your installation, import pyribs and print the version with this
command:

```bash
python -c "import ribs; print(ribs.__version__)"
```

You should see a version number in the output.

## Documentation

See here for the documentation: <https://docs.pyribs.org>

To serve the documentation locally, clone the repo and install the development
requirements with

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Then run

```bash
make servedocs
```

This will open a window in your browser with the documentation automatically
loaded. Furthermore, every time you make changes to the documentation, the
preview will also reload.
