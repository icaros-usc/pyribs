# Benchmarks

This directory contains scripts for running benchmarks. Note that we already run
several micro-benchmarks in our tests. This directory contains benchmarks that
are too large to run as part of CI/CD.

To run these benchmarks, install the dev dependencies for ribs
(`pip install ribs[dev]` or `pip install -e .[dev]`).
