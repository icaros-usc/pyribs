# Benchmarks

This directory contains scripts for running benchmarks. Note that we already run
several micro-benchmarks in our tests. This directory contains benchmarks that
are too large to run as part of CI/CD.

To run these benchmarks, you should have the dev dependencies installed for ribs
(`pip install ribs[dev]` or `pip install -e .[dev]`). You should also install
the full version of ribs (`pip install -e ribs[all]` or
`pip install -e .[all]`).
