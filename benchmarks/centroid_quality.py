"""Quantifies the performance of different centroid generation techniques

To measure how well a generation technique, i.e., random centroids, CVT, etc,
performs, we measure the probability of generating a random point within a
certain region defined by the centroid of that region.

The equations for this benchmark can be found in Mouret 2023:
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3583133.3590726.

Usage:
    python benchmarks.py

This script will generate centroids using 2 techniques, CVT and random
generation. These centroids will then be evaluated by the get_score()
function which will output a probability score between [0, 1].
