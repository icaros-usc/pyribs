    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat the Lunar Lander as a quality diversity (QD) problem. For the objective, we use the default rewards provided by the environment, which encourages landing on the landing pad and penalizes engine usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the measure functions, we are interested in several factors at the time of \"impact.\" We define impact to be the first time when either of the lunar lander's legs touches the ground. When this happens, we measure the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$-position: This will lead to markedly different trajectories, as seen earlier.\n",
    "- $y$-velocity: Different velocities will determine how hard the lander impacts the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the lunar lander never impacts the ground, we default the $x$-position to be the last $x$-position of the lander, and the $y$-velocity to be the maximum velocity of the lander (technically minimum since velocities are negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will search for policies that produce high-performing trajectories with these measures. For simplicity, we will use a linear policy to control the lunar lander. As the default lunar lander has discrete controls, the equation for this policy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = argmax(Ws)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the action to take, $s$ is the state vector, and $W$ is our model, a matrix of weights that stays constant. Essentially, we transform the state to a vector with a \"signal\" for each possible action in the action space, and we choose the action with the highest signal. To search for a different policy, we explore the space of models $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will search for policies solving a fixed scenario with a flat terrain. To create this scenario, we use a fixed seed of 52 in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Since our policy and environment are both deterministic, we only have to simulate the policy once to find its performance. Typically, we would run our policy multiple times to gauge average performance and have it generalize, but we ignore that to keep this example simple."

    "- Most of the high-performing solutions have lower impact $y$-velocities (see the bright area at the bottom of the map). This is reasonable, as a lander that crashes into the ground would not do well.\n",
    "- The high-performing solutions are spread across a wide range of impact $x$-positions. The highest solutions seem to be at $x \\approx 0$ (the bright spot in the middle). This makes sense since an impact $x$-position of 0 corresponds to the direct vertical approach. Nevertheless, there are many high-performing solutions that had other $x$-positions, and we will visualize them in the next section."

This method will look up the cell corresponding to the queried measures. Then, the method will check if there is an elite in that cell, and return the elite if it exists (the method does not check neighboring cells for elites). The returned elite may not have the exact measures requested because the elite only has to be in the same cell as the queried measures.\n",

    "**Note:** `find_elites_single` returns a single [Elite](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/api/ribs.archives.Elite.html) object given a single `measures` array. Meanwhile, the [`find_elites`](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/api/ribs.archives.GridArchive.html#ribs.archives.GridArchive.find_elites) method takes in a _batch_ of measures (named `measures_batch`) and returns an [EliteBatch](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/api/ribs.archives.EliteBatch.html) object. Several archive methods in pyribs follow a similar pattern of having a batch and single version, e.g., [`add`](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/api/ribs.archives.GridArchive.html#ribs.archives.GridArchive.add) and [`add_single`](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/api/ribs.archives.GridArchive.html#ribs.archives.GridArchive.add_single)."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As the saying goes, \"there is more than one way to land an airplane\" 😉. However, it is often difficult to shape the reward function in reinforcement learning to discover these unique and \"creative\" solutions. In such cases, a QD algorithm can help search for solutions that vary in \"interestingness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we showed that this is the case for the lunar lander environment. Using CMA-ME, we searched for lunar lander trajectories with differing impact measures. Though these trajectories all take a different approach, many perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extending this tutorial, we suggest the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace the impact measures with your own measures. What other properties might be interesting for the lunar lander?\n",
    "- Try different terrains by changing the seed. For instance, if the environment has valleys, can the lander learn to go into this valley and glide back up?\n",
    "- Use other gym environments. What measures could you use in an environment like `BipedalWalker-v2`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to learn about an algorithm which performs even better on this problem and other QD problems, check out the [Lunar Lander CMA-MAE tutorial](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/tutorials/lunar_lander_mae.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "And for a version of this tutorial that uses [Dask](https://dask.org) to parallelize evaluations and thus speed things up, refer to the [Lunar Lander example](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/examples/lunar_lander.html)."
