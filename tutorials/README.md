# Tutorials

The `tutorials` directory contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations;
see the [Tutorials](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) page in
the documentation for more information and the order in which the tutorials
should be read. To run tutorials locally, make sure to have
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
installed. Each notebook contains cell magic that installs the dependencies it
needs for execution.
