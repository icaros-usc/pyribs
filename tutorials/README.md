# Tutorials

The `tutorials` directory contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations;
these are described in more detail on the
[Tutorials](https://docs.pyribs.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) page in the
documentation. To run tutorials locally, make sure to have
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
installed. Each notebook contains cell magic that installs the dependencies it
needs for execution.
