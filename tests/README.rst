Tests
=====

This directory contains tests for ribs. The tests are separated into two parts.
The first is ``core``, which contains tests for the part of ribs that works with
``pip install ribs``. The second is ``extras``; these test the additional parts
that work when one installs the full ribs with ``pip install ribs[all]``.
